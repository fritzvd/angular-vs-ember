## Brightin

We've used Ember for a couple of apps, most of them aimed at mobile. (Examples)

## Ember
Known for:
* Skylight: https://www.skylight.io
* New Heroku dashboard: https://dashboard-next.heroku.com/
* Square dashboard: https://squareup.com/

# The good

* Convention. Much like Rails (which we also use). Awesome tooling and community which pushes this forward, mostly through Ember-CLI.

* Routing. Works out of the box and makes a lot of sense. And it's getting even better.

* The future. Backwards compatible. HTMLBars (React like rendering). Improvements all over.

# The bad

* Ember Data. You do it the Ember Data way or you go home. Fast.

* Testing. It's getting better, but QUnit? Ughhh.

* Big and slow (http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/mv-initial-load-times.html?utm_source=Ember+Weekly&utm_campaign=02e4a4a90a-Ember_Weekly_Issue_87&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e96229d21d-02e4a4a90a-106349833). But they hired Jony Ive. (https://speakerdeck.com/tomdale/ember-2-dot-0-in-practice)
