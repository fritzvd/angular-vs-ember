## Angular - The good

* Data binding, two-way all the way.
* Seperation of concerns is easy
* Promises out-of-the-box
* Testing is part of architecture
* There are more ways to skin a cat.
* Dependency Injection.
* Declarative templates
---

## Angular - The bad

* It's hard to find people who make big apps that agree on things.
* The documentation has only recently caught up, and remains complex.
* It's being maintained by Google
* There are more ways to skin a cat.
* Change detection vs digest loop
---

## Example time:
Easy 2-way binding.
