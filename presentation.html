# Data Binding

## Angular
* Choose between one way or two way binding
* `watch` changes easily

## Ember

* Two-way by default now
* In the future one-way will be standard

---

## Example time Angular:
Easy 2-way binding.
[Example](http://fritzvd.com/angular-vs-ember/angular-example.html)

Seperation of Concerns
[Example](http://fritzvd.com/angular-vs-ember/angular-example-services.html)

## Example time Ember:

Easy 2-way binding.

# Testing &amp; tooling

## Ember

* **ember-cli** is the way to go
* Built in testframework is **QUnit**
* Other frameworks are supported


## Angular

* Karma test runner was born around angular
* jasmine/mocha/qunit you choose
* grunt and gulp plugins are ubiquitous.

---

# Separation of concerns

## Angular

* MVC-ish. Angular has its own terminology and structure.
* Services make it easy to isolate business logic
* Easily create module/lib for general purpose

## Ember

* MVC structure (much like Rails)
* Routes are different but cool
* **ES6 modules** and Bower out of the box

---

# Convention vs. Configuration

## Ember

* Rails-like project setup
* Usually one way to do things
* **Ember Data** is very (too) opinionated

## Angular
* Lots of ways to do things
* You're probably doing it 7 different wrong ways

---

# Promises

## Angular

* An implementation of Kris Kowalâ€™s Q
* It's what will save your callback hell
* Restangular

## Ember

* **RSVP** is used by Ember
* Lots of things internally are promises
* And it's available to you

---

# Documentation

## Ember

* Guides and API docs
* Strong, but smaller community
* Watch out for outdated info

## Angular

* Complex, but keeps getting better
* Lots of excellent blog posts contradict each other ðŸ˜‚

---

# The future

## Angular

* 2.0 has been announced and it will break stuff
* Controllers are out. But who needs those anyways
* ES6, shadow dom, web components etc.

## Ember

* Faster and smaller
* Controllers are out. **Components** become central.
* **HTMLBars** which brings the awesome of React
* **Backwards compatible!**

---

# Angular general notes

## Good

* There are more ways to skin a cat.
* Dependency Injection.
* Declarative templates

## The bad

* It's hard to find people who make big apps that agree on things.
* The documentation has only recently caught up, and remains complex.
* It's being maintained by Google
* There are more ways to skin a cat.
* Change detection vs digest loop

---

# Ember general notes

## Good

* Awesome defaults
* Get up and running fast
* Nothing is a POJO

## Bad

* Big and slow
* Ember Data
* Nothing is a POJO
